			<h2>Official Home of the GS Club</h2>

			<h2>Backstory</h2>
			<p>Founded in 2018 by Aramis, GS didn't see much action throughout its early days, serving as just a community and gathering place.
				Aramis toiled away at trying to make this an enjoyable place were people could gather, and have the best names in many genres all under
				one banner. After time passed and the company built a good rapport, Aramis went on with his life, leaving GS to continue on its path with
				Aramis less involved in its businesses. Alas the club started gaining traction, people started banding together under the GS flag and had
				good times, and after gaining a massive popularity people started communicating, this is when people formed groups and got together to
				compete in different genre's of games, we were one of the first clubs to participate in the new competitive format for Brawl Stars,
				"Club League" which had ranks from rookie to master, as you can imagine the race was on and every club competed to the best of their ability
				to bethe first team at the top of the charts. After a couple months GS had finally made it to the top of the charts, having conquered Brawl
				Stars the anxious members of GS continue to participate in many public events, bring trophies from near and far.
			</p>

			<h2>GS Ranks & Pay</h2>
			<p>After becoming such a massive org, the company needed people in chair, working behind the scenes to keep the online servers running, 
				the center of legends, GS' main headquarters and gathering place, and so you can apply to join the team, we see here the ranks and
				pay offer available to a typical employee.

				be promoted to the head of that department. (e.g merch, social media, tema management, coach, etc.)
